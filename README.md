# Project Title

Theses are my dotfiles, scripts or configs that I use.

### Be aware

Some of those files need some extra configuration or may not work on your system. I use arch linux and all the scripts was based on what arch provided.
Some scripts may require to download something for them to work.

### Installing

To use them you just need to copy and place those files on your system. 

## Running the scripts
You can use bash or './' I like to use symbolic links to run them.  
To be able to execute those scripts without need to use 'bash' you will have to give permission.

```
chmod +x ~/bin/scrits.sh
```

```
bash ~/bin/script.sh
```

```
cd ~/bin; ./script.sh
```

```
sudo ln -s ~/bin/script.sh /usr/bin/script
```
